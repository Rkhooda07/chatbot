# Simple React Chatbot (Learning Project)

This is a basic chatbot built using **React** to understand core frontend concepts like components, state, props, and asynchronous responses. This project has **no backend** and is purely for learning and experimentation.

It simulates chatbot responses using a simple JavaScript logic instead of real AI.
